Sure, here is a simple README file for a testing tutorial for adding two numbers and testing it with Jest framework for GitHub:

## Adding Two Numbers and Testing with Jest

This tutorial demonstrates how to write tests for a simple function that adds two numbers using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.

### Setting up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and initialize it as a npm package using the following command:

```
npm init -y
```

2. Install Jest using the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

### Writing the Function to Add Two Numbers

Create a file named `sum.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = sum;
```

This function simply adds two numbers and returns the result.

### Writing Tests for the Function

Create a file named `sum.test.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});

test('adds 3 + 4 to equal 7', () => {
  expect(sum(3, 4)).toBe(7);
});

test('adds negative numbers -1 + -2 to equal -3', () => {
  expect(sum(-1, -2)).toBe(-3);
});
```

These tests cover different scenarios for adding two numbers, including positive, negative, and mixed numbers.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```
npm test
```

Jest will execute the tests and report the results. If all tests pass, you should see the following output:

```
PASS ./sum.test.js
  ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
  ✓ adds 3 + 4 to equal 7 (1ms)
  ✓ adds negative numbers -1 + -2 to equal -3 (1ms)
```

Congratulations! You have successfully written tests for the function using Jest.
